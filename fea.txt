There are several features that could be added to enhance this app. Here are a few ideas:

1. Allow the user to input multiple URLs: Rather than analyzing headlines from just one URL, the app could allow the user to input multiple URLs and analyze the sentiment of headlines from all the websites.

2. Add support for different languages: Currently, the app only supports sentiment analysis for headlines in English. Adding support for other languages would make the app more versatile and useful for users who read financial news in different languages.

3. Use machine learning models for sentiment analysis: While Vader is a useful tool for sentiment analysis, it has some limitations. Using more advanced machine learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) could potentially provide more accurate sentiment analysis.

4. Provide more detailed stock market predictions: Rather than simply saying whether the market is likely to go up or down, the app could provide more detailed predictions, such as predicting which sectors or industries are likely to perform well or poorly based on the sentiment of the headlines.

5. Allow the user to filter headlines: The app could allow the user to filter headlines based on specific keywords or topics of interest, allowing them to focus on the news that is most relevant to their investment strategy.
